# Welcome to MagicWave documentation.

MagicWave is an open-source project that extends [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/download/tor/) with an [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) caching layer and a [Stellar-based](https://www.stellar.org/learn/intro-to-stellar) monetization layer. You can find more details in the architecture [page](https://github.com/magicwave-io/docs/blob/master/MagicWave%20Architecture.md).

To access MagicWave content you can download the official client [here](https://magicwave.io/download/), which will install the MagicWave Extension for Chrome. Alternatively, you can build the client from [sources](https://github.com/magicwave-io/go-ipfs).
To participate in the MagicWave network (and earn MagicWave tokens), you can either start a network [provider node](https://github.com/magicwave-io/docs/blob/master/Docker%20Installation%20Instructions%20--%20content%20provider.md), which provides Tor forwarding and anonymity services and IPFS storage/caching services. Weâ€™ve provided a docker [image](https://hub.docker.com/r/magicwaveio/production) to simplify setting up a new node.

You can also start a MagicWave web server. You can follow the instructions ([wiki](https://github.com/magicwave-io/Wiki_Site/blob/dev/README.md), [video](https://github.com/magicwave-io/Video_Site/blob/main/README.md), [audio](https://github.com/magicwave-io/Audio_Site/blob/dev/README.md) sites) or take a look at the example sites ([wiki](https://magicwave.wikitpdemo.com/), [video](https://magicwave.videotpdemo.com/), [audio](https://magicwave.podcasttpdemo.com/)) (you will need the MagicWave client to access those). The source code for these sites is here ([wiki](https://github.com/magicwave-io/Wiki_Site), [video](https://github.com/magicwave-io/Video_Site), [audio](https://github.com/magicwave-io/Audio_Site/)). You can freely copy and extend those samples.
